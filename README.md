# 9to5Developer-TechBlog

## Description 

As a developer who writes about tech. I want a CMS-style blog site so that I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions. The blog follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
